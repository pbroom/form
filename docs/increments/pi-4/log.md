# Increment Log â€“ PI-4

## Entry 1

Initializing PI-4 with focus on shippable Code Node, safe runtime preview, minimal codegen integration, and UX hardening.

- Action: Created PI-4 charter and log from templates
- Files/Areas: `docs/increments/pi-4/charter.md`, `docs/increments/pi-4/log.md`
- Decisions: Keep ARCHITECTURE.md as source of truth; defer advanced editor QoL
- Issues/Risks: Sandbox complexity and deterministic execution
- Learnings: Tight scope accelerates delivery
- Tests/Artifacts: TBD
