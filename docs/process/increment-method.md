# Increment Method (Lean TDD for Humans + LLMs)

A lightweight structure to drive incremental, measurable progress without heavy process. Two artifacts per increment:

- Increment Charter (IC): source-of-truth plan for the increment
- Increment Log (IL): short running log after each meaningful change (commit/PR/LLM update)

## Goals

- Preserve necessary context for deep-dives while trimming irrelevant detail
- Make progress measurable with test-first (TDD) ACs
- Enable any human/agent to resume quickly

## Naming

- Increments: `pi-1`, `pi-2`, ...
- Files: `docs/increments/pi-1/charter.md`, `docs/increments/pi-1/log.md`

## Current Increment Identification

**For Humans and LLMs:** The current active increment is the earliest increment that is **not marked as Done**.

- **Completed increments** are marked with ‚úÖ Done status in their charter
- **Current increment** is the first one without Done status
- **Future increments** may exist in draft form but are not active

Example progression:

- PI-1: ‚úÖ Done (completed)
- PI-2: ‚úÖ Done (completed)
- PI-3: üîÑ In progress (current - work here)
- PI-4: üìã Draft (future - don't start yet)

Always check increment status before assuming which is current!

## Increment Charter (IC)

Contains:

- Context Capsule: high-level aim + constraints to keep efforts aligned
- Focus: 1‚Äì2 sentences describing the slice we‚Äôre shipping
- Prioritized ACs: cornerstone acceptance criteria for the slice
- Efforts: list of efforts; for each: tasks, ACs, tests (TDD), steps, estimate (S/M/L), status checklist
- Scope Fence: what is intentionally out-of-scope for this increment
- Exit Criteria: what makes the increment done (all tests pass; demoable)

## Increment Log (IL)

- Each entry starts with a 1‚Äì2 sentence Summary in plain, concise English
- Short bullets: action, files touched, decisions, issues, learnings, tests/artifacts
- Keep it terse; 3‚Äì6 bullets per entry

## TDD Loop (for each task)

1. Define/confirm ACs and tests
2. Write tests/fixtures (fail)
3. Implement minimal code
4. Make tests pass; refactor
5. Update IC status; add IL entry (include links/screens)

## Context Management

- IC holds the current ‚Äúcontext capsule‚Äù ‚Äì copy forward and prune each increment
- IL references decisions; only key decisions graduate into ADRs (optional)

## Feedback Assessment Process

Use `/p -f <feedback>` to submit concerns, feature requests, or ideas for contextual evaluation:

- **Context Analysis**: Feedback assessed against completed work, current increment, PRD goals, and roadmap
- **Categorization**: Already Planned, Enhancement, New Feature, Concern/Risk, or Process Improvement
- **Priority Assessment**: Immediate (current increment), Next Increment, Backlog, or PRD Update
- **Integration Strategy**: Recommendations that preserve current momentum while capturing value

This ensures good ideas aren't lost while maintaining focus on current priorities.

## Templates

See `docs/increments/_templates/charter.template.md` and `docs/increments/_templates/log.template.md`.

## Source of Truth

- For system intent, modules, and roadmap, refer to `docs/architecture/ARCHITECTURE.md` as the canonical document. The PRD (`docs/architecture/prd.md`) is supportive context and may lag behind.

## Project Log

- At the end of each increment, update `docs/project-log.md` with a concise, human-readable summary (outcomes, artifacts, decisions, learnings)
- Keep increment-level details in `docs/increments/<id>/log.md`; the project log is a top-level, per-increment changelog
